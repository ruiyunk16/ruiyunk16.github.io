Here is **Ruiyun Kang (Ryan)**.<br>

I am a graduate student at Cornell University, pursuing an M.Eng. in Operations Research & Information Engineering with a focus on Financial Engineering. Previously, I earned my B.A. in Applied Mathematics and a minor in Data Science at UC Berkeley. My academic work sits at the intersection of mathematics, statistics, and computing, and Iâ€™m particularly excited about applying rigorous quantitative methods to problems in finance.
