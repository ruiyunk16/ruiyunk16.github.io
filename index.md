Here is **Ruiyun Kang (Ryan, 康瑞昀)**.<br>

I am a graduate student in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge, advised by [Prof. Özgür Akan](https://ioe.eng.cam.ac.uk/directory/akan), within [Internet of Everything (IoE) Group](https://ioe.eng.cam.ac.uk/). I also spent a lovely summer research program with [Prof. Pietro Liò](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) at [Artificial Intelligence Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/ai/). Prior to Cambridge,  I have worked on System Engineering, Cybersecurity and Wireless Communication with [Prof. Zhezhuang Xu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=iZ7LQRkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Dr. Meng Yuan](https://myuan27.github.io/).
